This pairwise differential expression (PDE) workfow report was generated using Searchlight 2 (<*SL2_version*>). The normalised expression matrix at <*normexp_file_path*> was combined with the background file at <*background_file_path*>, retaining only the <*expression_set_size*> genes that were present in both, to create the "expression set". Per sample group mean expression values and standard devitations per gene were calulated using numpy.

Next the differential expression table at <*PDE_file_path*> which compares the two sample groups <*PDE_numerator*> and <*PDE_denominator*>, was combined with the expression set, retaining only the <*differential_expression_set_size*> genes that were present in both, to create the "differential expression set". Next a list of significantly differentially expressed genes was generated from the differential expression set using the adjusted p threshold of <*PDE_padj*> and the absolute log2fold theshold of > <*PDE_log2fold*>. Finally, all plots were generated as described in the figure legends of this report, using the R script at /PDE/<*workflow_ID*>/plots/workflow.r, and as described in the figure legends of this report.
