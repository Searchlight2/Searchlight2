This normalised expression workfow (normexp) report was generated using Searchlight 2 (<*SL2_version*>). The normalised expression matrix at <*normexp_file_path*> was combined with the background file at <*background_file_path*>, retaining only the <*expression_set_size*> genes that were present in both. Per sample group mean expression values and standard devitations per gene were calulated using numpy. Finally, all plots were generated as described in the figure legends of this report, using the R script at /normexp/plots/workflow.r.
