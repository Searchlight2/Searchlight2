Scatterplots showing the relationship between the fold changes of two different differential comparisons. Plots for each pairwise combination of the differential comparisons: <*mpde_comparisons*>, is given. For each plot genes are given as dots, the log2 fold changes are given on the x and y-axis. Genes that are significant in both comparisons are show in red, in the x-axis comparison only as blue, in the y-axis comparison only as green and neither comparison as black. The Spearman Correlation coefficient for the plot is given in the header. The right hand plots show the gene symbols for all genes.
