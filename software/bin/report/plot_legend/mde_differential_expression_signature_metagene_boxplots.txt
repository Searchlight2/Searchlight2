Violin plots highlighting the pattern of expression for each differential expression signature, across the sample groups: <*sample_groups*>. Each dot is one sample, with sample groups given on the x-axis and the mean gene expression value for the signature on the y-axis. The mean and standard error for each sample group is given as a red dot and line. Mean gene expression values were calculated by first scaling expression values on a gene-by-gene basis using the z-score transformation, then calculating the mean z-score across all genes in the signature, for each sample.
