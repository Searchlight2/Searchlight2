Hierarchically clustered heatmap of the significantly differentially expressed genes for the comparisons: <*mpde_comparisons*>, for all sample in the sample groups: <*sample_groups*>. Samples are on the x axis and genes on the y axis. Colour intensity represents expression level, with blue representing low expression, and red representing high expression. Expression levels have been row scaled into z−scores. The y-axis (both plots) and x-axis (right plot) have been hierarchically clustered using, Spearman distances, with UPMGA agglomeration and mean reordering.
