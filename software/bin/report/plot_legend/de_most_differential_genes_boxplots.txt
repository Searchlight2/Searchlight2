Violin plots showing for each of the 10 most upregulated and downregulated genes by adjusted p-value and log2fold change. Showing expression values for all samples in the sample groups: <*sample_groups*>. Each dot is one sample, with sample groups given on the x-axis and gene expression on the y-axis. The mean and standard error for each sample group is given as a red dot and line.
