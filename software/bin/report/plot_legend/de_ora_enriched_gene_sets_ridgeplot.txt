Summary ridgeplot of the ten most enriched genes sets for: all significantly differentially expressed genes (p.adj < <*de_padj*>, absolute log2 fold > <*de_log2fold*>) between <*de_numerator*> and <*de_denominator*>, significantly upregulated genes and significantly downregulated genes. Upregulated genes are higher expression in <*de_numerator*> than in <*de_denominator*>. For each plot the -log10 enrichment p-value is given on the x-axis and the gene set name on the y-axis. Data labels represent the number of significantly differential expressed genes within each gene set. Enrichment analysis was performed using Hypergeometric Gene Set Enrichment on the gene set databases <*hypergeom_gene_set_databases*>. Significantly enriched gene sets (p.adj < <*hypergeom_gene_set_padj*>, absolute log2 fold > <*hypergeom_gene_set_log2fold*>) are coloured red and non-significant black.
