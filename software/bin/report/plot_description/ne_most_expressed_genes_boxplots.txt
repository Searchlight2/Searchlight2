Here we provide a violin plot for each of the ten most highly expressed genes in each sample group. Looking at the most highly expressed genes can be a useful control for the success of the experiment technically - as we often expect many of these to be housekeeping genes (such as ACTB or GAPDH) or cell type specific genes. If the top 10 most highly expressed genes appear surprising or difficult to understand biologically, this can indicate an issue with the sequencing or data processing steps. Using a violin plot it can be interesting to see how consistent the expression of the top 10 gene are between sample groups. For example it can be useful to see know if housekeeping genes are consistently expressed between sample groups.
