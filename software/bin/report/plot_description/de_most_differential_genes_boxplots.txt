Here we provide violin plots for the ten most highly upregulated and most highly downregulated genes by p-value and log2 fold change. It is often useful to visually inspect the behaviour of the samples and the general expression levels at these genes. Generally we expect significant genes to have obvious visual differences between the sample groups, and not seeing this can indicate issues with the method for calling differential expression or a too relaxed p or fold cut-off. The spread of the samples within a sample group gives an idea of sample heterogeneity at a given gene. The levels of expression at a given gene can be useful for choosing candidate genes for validation (more highly expressed genes are often easier to validate).
