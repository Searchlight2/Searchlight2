One of the core aims of differential expression analysis is to understand which pathways and areas of biology any differentially expressed genes represent. One method to determine this is hyper-geometric gene-set enrichment analysis (HGSEA). In HGSEA the significantly different genes are compared to a database (e.g. GO terms, KEGG) of pre-defined lists of genes (gene-sets) - each of which represents a specific pathway or area of biology (e.g. Cell Cycle, TNF signalling). A hyper-geometric test is then used to determine whether each gene-set is enriched or not for the significantly differential genes. The most enriched gene-sets have the lowest p-values.

As individual genes can have several different functions, and several different gene-sets in a database might describe a similar biology (e.g. cell-cycle, G1 phase, replication) there is often considerable redundancy in gene-set databases and thus enrichment results. I.e. often there are many enriched gene-sets that contain very similar genes, and so are themselves very similar. This can often mean that the ten most enriched gene-sets are highly similar, and only represent a portion of the enriched biology. It is therefore highly useful to view all gene-set enrichment results as a network, where each node is a gene-set and each edge links gene-sets with highly similar genes. This often gives rise to clusters of gene-sets with similar function. When viewing these plots it is more important to consider the general biological theme of each cluster rather than the exact details of the gene-sets or genes within them. Networks are given for the enriched gene-sets for: all significantly differential genes, significantly upregulated genes and significantly downregulated genes.
